# Your Project's Name
My project is about creating a website mainly for people to navigate and search locations. The "Home" page allows people to navigate through different functions throught the different icons. The first one allows people to search for locations, the second provides directions to their destinations and the third helps them to find carpark locations near them.

"Home page"
This page conntains a header which indicates a name called 'location searcher'. Below the heading at the top-left side of the page is an api implemented to display the current weather.

On the center of the page is three different icons to navigate to different pages.
